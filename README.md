## Installation
<a id='installation'></a>
The following packages need to be installed for running the analysis;
1. tweepy 
2. requests
```
pip install tweepy
pip install requests
```

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
<a id='projectmotivation'></a>
For this project, I was interested analysing WeRateDogs, a twitter account with over 4M+ followers & has received international media coverage. This analysis displays data gathering skills where data has been obtained by using an API in the form of a JSON file & has been converted into a dataframe for analysis. Another dataset which was used for this analysis was downloaded programmatically using requests.

## File Descriptions
<a id='filedescriptions'></a>
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above techniques. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
1. twitter-archive-enhanced.csv - Contains tweet information of all tweets from the WeRateDogs account.

## Results
<a id='results'></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://amankumbhani.medium.com/this-analysis-will-make-you-take-a-trip-with-airbnb-3d2aca5a5fc6).
